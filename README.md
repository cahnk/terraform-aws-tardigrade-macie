# terraform-aws-tardigrade-guardduty

Terraform module to create a standard GuardDuty configuration in a single AWS account.  These include a GuardDuty detector, filter, ipset, threatintelset, and publshing destination.  GuardDuty configurations that require multiple AWS accounts are not included in this module, and the terraform code for those configurations has been implemented in seperate submodeles (see the modules section of this project).

 - Creates a GuardDuty detector for this account
 - Creates a GuardDuty filter for this account if the filter var is not null.
 - Creates a GuardDuty ipset for this account if the ipset var is not null.
 - Creates a GuardDuty threatintelset for this account if the threatintelset var is not null.
 - Creates a GuardDuty publishing_destination for this account if the publishing_destination var is not null.

 Prerequisites:  This publishing_destination resource assumes the S3 bucket associated with the destination arn exists and the required policies have been created to
 allow GuardDuty to access the bucket.  It also assumes the kms key associated with the kms key arn exists and has a policy that allows GuardDuty to to use it.

## Testing

You can find example implementations of this module in the tests folder (create_all_guardduty_standard_resources).
